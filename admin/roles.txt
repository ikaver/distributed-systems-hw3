System administrator:

	2. Run python script that creates master nodes and participants (input = config.txt)
	3. Run script that prints information of the system (input = config.txt or master ip and port number). 
		Operations:
			list-jobs : Returns list of jobs with job ids
			get-job-info <JOB_ID> : Gives list of mappers/reducers associated to each job.
			kill-job <JOB_ID> : Kills the job and returns the mappers and reducers to the "available" pool.
			kill-system

Application programmer:

	1. Create mapper task 

		We need to create a Mapper Interface
	
	2. Create reduce task 

		We need to create a Reducer Interface

	3. Run bundle creator script 

		We need to create a bundle creator script (What if it has additional dependencies? What is the entry point of the program? Do we need to use some kind of reflection here?)

		python bundle_creator.py <BUNDLE_JAR> <MAPPER CLASS PATH> <REDUCER CLASS PATH>

	4. Run work creator script
		python run-mr.py <configuration-file-path>
